# `jdaidb` - Educational Database Management System in Python

![sunbears, not your pandas alternative](thumbnail.png)

`jdaidb` is an educational database management system written in Python. This system is not ready for production. Please use it at your risk.

This system is based on the great Codd's Relational data model. It is enhanced with the fake LRU-based buffer pool for OLTP-based workloads. This system also supports a subset of SQL-92 with decent implementations of relational operators. This system does not support multiple users at the same time (i.e., concurrent access).

## Integration Dependency
This system must be used with `sunbears`'s DataFrame.
